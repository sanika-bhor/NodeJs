# Node.js Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Node.js repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and exercises that highlight my journey in learning Node.js. Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, allowing for fast and scalable network applications. I'm exploring various aspects of Node.js, including:

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- **Express.js**: Building robust web applications and APIs with this popular Node.js framework.
- **Database Integration**: Connecting and interacting with databases like MongoDB and MySQL.
- **Web Server Development**: Building and deploying web servers with Node.js.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.
- **File I/O**: Handling file operations such as reading, writing, and streaming data.
- **MVC Architecture**: Structuring applications following the Model-View-Controller pattern for better organization and maintainability.
- **State Management**: Managing application state efficiently in server-side applications.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in 
      JavaScript.
- **Error Handling**: Writing robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure application reliability.
- **Frontend and Backend Integration**: Combining Node.js backend with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build full-stack 
      applications.
- **RESTful APIs**: Designing and implementing REST APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- **Templating Engines (EJS)**: Using EJS to dynamically generate HTML content on the server-side.
- **Event-driven architecture**: Implementing event-driven architecture with EventEmitter to handle custom events and communication between 
     modules.
- **Middleware**: Using middleware functions in Express.js for handling requests, authentication, and more.
