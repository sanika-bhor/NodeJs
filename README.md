# Node.js Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Node.js repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and exercises that highlight my journey in learning Node.js. Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, allowing for fast and scalable network applications. I'm exploring various aspects of Node.js, including:

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- **Express.js**: Building robust web applications and APIs with this popular Node.js framework.
- **Database Integration**: Connecting and interacting with databases like MongoDB and MySQL.
